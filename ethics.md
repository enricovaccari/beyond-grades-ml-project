##  Ethical Considerations
- The dataset is **anonymized and cleaned**, and released under **CC BY 4.0**, ensuring legal reusability.  
- **Privacy and informed consent** remain important considerations given the student population.  
- Researchers must **avoid reinforcing stereotypes** (e.g., gender, socioeconomic status).  
- Measures such as **GPA and GradeClass may reflect grading practices or teacher bias**; predictions should be used to **support** students, not penalize them.
